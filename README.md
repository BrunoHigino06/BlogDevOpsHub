# BlogOps

**Note:** This README is a work in progress and may change as the project evolves.

Welcome to **BlogOps**, a personal project combining a blog setup with modern DevOps technologies. This project integrates Ghost CMS with Kubernetes, Prometheus, Ansible, Jenkins, and ArgoCD to create a streamlined deployment and monitoring pipeline for a Ghost blog. Terraform is used for provisioning instances and managing infrastructure.

## Introduction

**BlogOps** is designed to provide an efficient blogging platform by leveraging Kubernetes for orchestration, Prometheus for monitoring, Ansible for automation, Jenkins for CI/CD, and ArgoCD for GitOps continuous deployment. Terraform is used for provisioning and managing instances.

## Project Structure

- **/src**: Contains the Ghost blog source code and configuration.
- **/infrastructure**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files for Kubernetes, Prometheus, and other configurations.
- **/terraform**: Terraform configurations for provisioning instances and managing infrastructure.
- **/ansible**: Ansible playbooks for automation and deployment tasks.
- **/jenkins**: Jenkins configurations and pipelines.
- **/argocd**: ArgoCD configurations for continuous deployment.

## Technologies Used

- **Ghost**: CMS for the blog.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration platform for deploying and managing containerized applications.
- **Prometheus**: Monitoring and alerting toolkit.
- **Ansible**: Automation tool for deploying applications and managing configurations.
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD server for automating builds, tests, and deployments.
- **ArgoCD**: GitOps continuous deployment tool.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code tool for provisioning instances and managing cloud resources.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/blogops.git
    cd blogops
    ```

2. **Set up Terraform:**
    - Navigate to the `/terraform` directory.
    - Update the `terraform.tfvars` file with your cloud provider details and other required configurations.
    - Initialize and apply Terraform:
        ```bash
        terraform init
        terraform apply
        ```

3. **Set up Kubernetes:**
    - Make sure you have a Kubernetes cluster running.
    - Apply Kubernetes manifests from `/infrastructure/k8s` to deploy necessary resources.

4. **Configure Prometheus:**
    - Apply Prometheus configuration files from `/infrastructure/prometheus`.
    - Verify Prometheus is monitoring the necessary metrics.

5. **Deploy the Ghost blog:**
    - Use Ansible playbooks from `/ansible` to deploy the Ghost blog.
    - Configure the blog settings as needed.

6. **Set up Jenkins:**
    - Configure Jenkins with the provided pipelines from `/jenkins`.
    - Ensure Jenkins is integrated with your Git repository.

7. **Set up ArgoCD:**
    - Configure ArgoCD with the provided configurations from `/argocd`.
    - Verify that ArgoCD is monitoring your Git repository for changes.

## Usage

After completing the setup and installation:

- Access the Ghost blog via the configured URL.
- Monitor metrics and performance using Prometheus.
- Utilize Jenkins and ArgoCD for CI/CD and continuous deployment.
